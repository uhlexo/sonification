# Turning Data Into Sound

Making sonifications out of data isn't as hard as you might think. I'm definitely not an engineer, I'm an analyst and a musician.

As of this writing (2019-08-01), I'm only publishing a very very simple demo of how to make a quick sonification that will control CC messages in a midi file. I've made maybe 30 of these so far, but it's all using Postmates data, which can be too sensitive to publish in a raw form.

I'll try to upload generalized working versions of some of the more complex sonifications that I've made.
